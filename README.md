# Decisions From Experience

Matlab code relying on [Psychtoolbox 3](http://psychtoolbox.org) and the Statistics Toolbox to execute an experiment. This is an EEG experiment. To send markers, you should use the [io64 module](http://apps.usd.edu/coglab/psyc770/IO64.html) - however, you will need Windows and a parallel port for that.

For more information, [read the documentation!](documents/DFE_docu.pdf)
