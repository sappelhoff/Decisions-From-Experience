# Decisions From Experience
---
Matlab code relying on [Psychtoolbox 3](http://psychtoolbox.org) and the Statistics Toolbox to execute an experiment. This is an EEG experiment. To send markers, you should use the [io64 module](http://apps.usd.edu/coglab/psyc770/IO64.html) - however, you will need Windows and a parallel port for that.

Participants will be shown these [instructions](documents/DFE_instructions.pdf).

After finishing the experiment, they will be asked [these questions](documents/InterviewQuestions.pdf).
